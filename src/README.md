# SOLID Principles
SOLID is a set of principles for object-oriented software design that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. It stands for:

* S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Let's take a closer look at each principle and some examples:
## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility, and all its methods and properties should be related to that responsibility.

For example, consider a class that handles both authentication and data storage. This violates the SRP because the class has multiple responsibilities. It would be better to separate authentication and data storage into separate classes.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new features to a system without modifying its existing code.

For example, consider a class that calculates the area of a rectangle. If you want to add support for calculating the area of a circle, you should create a new class that extends the rectangle class, rather than modifying the rectangle class itself.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This principle states that if you have a base class and a derived class, you should be able to use the derived class wherever the base class is expected, without any issues.

For example, consider a base class called Shape with a method called area(). If you have a derived class called Rectangle, it should be able to be used anywhere you expect a Shape. In other words, calling area() on a Rectangle should return the area of the rectangle, just like calling area() on a Shape.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, you should create separate interfaces for different functionality, rather than one large interface that covers everything.

For example, consider an interface that has methods for both reading and writing data. If a client only needs to read data, it should not be forced to implement the write methods as well. Instead, you should create separate interfaces for reading and writing.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions.

For example, consider a high-level module that depends on a low-level module to read and write data. Instead of depending directly on the low-level module, you should create an abstraction, such as an interface, that both the high-level and low-level modules depend on. This allows you to easily swap out the low-level module with a different implementation in the future, without affecting the high-level module.

In summary, the SOLID principles provide guidelines for creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. By following these principles, you can create software that is easier to understand, modify, and extend.
